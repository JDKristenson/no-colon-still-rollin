## ✨ What Was Fixed

### Major Improvements
- ✅ Fixed `.replit` config to use `$PORT` environment variable
- ✅ Added CORS support for all Replit domains
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript compilation errors (frontend now builds cleanly)
- ✅ Added `.replitignore` for faster deployments
- ✅ Optimized backend port configuration
- ✅ Tested build process locally - everything works!

### Technical Details
**Backend Changes:**
- Dynamic CORS with regex for `*.replit.dev`, `*.replit.app`, `*.repl.co`
- PORT environment variable with fallback to 8000
- Already serves static files from `frontend/dist` ✅

**Frontend Changes:**
- Fixed TypeScript errors in Compliance, Protocol, and MealPlanner pages
- Build completes successfully
- Proper proxy configuration for development

**Configuration:**
- `.replit` now uses `$PORT` in deployment command
- Added `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` for better logging
- Created `.replitignore` to exclude unnecessary files

## 📊 Architecture

**Production (Deployed):**
```
User → Replit URL → Backend (FastAPI) → API + Static Files
                                      └→ SQLite Database
```

**Development (Run button):**
```
Backend :8000 ← Proxy ← Frontend Dev Server :5173
```

## 🧪 Quick Tests After Deploy

### 1. Health Check
```
https://your-repl-name.username.repl.co/health
```
Should return: `{"status": "healthy", ...}`

### 2. Frontend
```
https://your-repl-name.username.repl.co/
```
Should load the dashboard

### 3. API Test
```
https://your-repl-name.username.repl.co/api/foods/
```
Should return list of foods

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Build Fails
- Check Replit build logs
- Ensure dependencies install correctly
- Frontend should build to `frontend/dist`

### CORS Errors
- Should be automatically handled
- Check browser console for specific origin
- Can add to `CORS_ORIGINS` env variable if needed

### Database Issues
- Auto-creates on first run
- Stored in `backend/app/core/data/cancer_foods.db`
- Check logs for initialization errors

### Frontend Doesn't Load
- Verify `frontend/dist` exists after build
- Check that backend serves static files
- Visit `/health` to confirm backend is running
