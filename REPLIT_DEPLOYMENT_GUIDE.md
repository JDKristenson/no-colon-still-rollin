# Replit Deployment Guide - Ready to Deploy!

## ✅ Status: OPTIMIZED FOR REPLIT

Your application has been fully refactored and optimized for deployment on Replit. All configuration issues have been resolved.

## 🚀 Quick Deploy Steps

### 1. Import to Replit
1. Go to [Replit.com](https://replit.com)
2. Click **"Create Repl"** → **"Import from GitHub"**
3. Enter: `https://github.com/JDKristenson/no-colon-still-rollin.git`
4. Click **"Import from GitHub"**

### 2. Set Environment Variables (Optional but Recommended)
In your Repl, go to the **Secrets** tab (lock icon) and add:
- `NCBI_EMAIL`: Your email for PubMed API (for research features)
- `NCBI_API_KEY`: (optional) PubMed API key for higher rate limits

### 3. Deploy
1. Click the **"Deploy"** button (rocket icon)
2. Wait for the build process to complete
3. Your app will be live at your Repl URL!

That's it! 🎉

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Configuration Changes
1. **`.replit` file**
   - Updated deployment command to use `$PORT` environment variable
   - Added `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` for better logging
   - Build command properly installs and builds frontend
   - Run command starts backend which serves the built frontend

2. **Backend (FastAPI)**
   - Dynamic CORS configuration that automatically allows:
     - Local development (`localhost:5173`, `localhost:3000`)
     - All Replit domains (`*.replit.dev`, `*.replit.app`, `*.repl.co`)
   - PORT environment variable with fallback to 8000
   - Proper static file serving from `frontend/dist`

3. **Frontend (React/Vite)**
   - Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
   - Optimized build process
   - Proper proxy configuration for development

4. **Database**
   - SQLite configuration already perfect for Replit
   - Creates database in proper location automatically
   - No additional setup needed

5. **`.replitignore` file**
   - Speeds up deployments by excluding unnecessary files
   - Prevents node_modules and build artifacts from being synced

## 📋 Key Features That Now Work

✅ Single-command deployment
✅ Automatic frontend build process
✅ Backend serves built frontend automatically
✅ CORS configured for all Replit domains
✅ Dynamic port configuration
✅ SQLite database persistence
✅ Health check endpoint at `/health`
✅ All API endpoints functional

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, test these endpoints:

### Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-repl-name.username.repl.co/health
```
Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "message": "No Colon, Still Rollin'"
}
```

### Frontend
Visit: `https://your-repl-name.username.repl.co/`
Should see the application dashboard

### API Endpoints
- `/api/status/` - Dashboard data
- `/api/protocol/today` - Today's protocol
- `/api/foods/` - All foods in database
- `/api/weight/history` - Weight tracking history

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Production Mode (Deployed)
```
Replit → Backend (FastAPI on $PORT) → Serves /api/* + Static Files (frontend/dist)
```

### Development Mode (Run button)
```
Replit → start.sh → Backend :8000 + Frontend Dev Server :5173
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check the build logs in Replit
2. Ensure all dependencies install correctly
3. Verify the database directory can be created

### If CORS errors occur:
- The regex pattern should catch all Replit domains
- Check the browser console for specific origin
- Can manually add to CORS_ORIGINS environment variable if needed

### If frontend doesn't load:
- Verify build completed successfully (check for `frontend/dist` folder)
- Check that backend is serving static files
- Visit `/health` endpoint to confirm backend is running

### Database issues:
- Database auto-creates on first run
- Check logs for any initialization errors
- Database stored in `backend/app/core/data/cancer_foods.db`

## 🔄 Updating Your Deployment

After making code changes:

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   git push
   ```

2. **In Replit:**
   - Click the version control icon
   - Pull latest changes
   - Redeploy

Or just edit directly in Replit and redeploy.

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Replit** using the steps above
2. **Test all functionality** using the testing guide
3. **Set environment variables** for PubMed integration (optional)
4. **Share your Repl URL** with users
