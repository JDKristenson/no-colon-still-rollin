# Instructions for Comet to Verify Password

## Request for Comet AI Browser

The connection string format is correct, but password authentication is failing. I need Comet to verify the actual password.

### Task for Comet:

1. **Go to**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wpyntnmjncdizglqedyl/settings/database

2. **Find the Database Password**:
   - Look for "Database Password" section
   - Or "Reset Password" option
   - Check if the password shown is actually `2022Freshstart` or if it's different/masked

3. **Check Connection String**:
   - Go to "Connection string" section
   - Look at the connection strings - are they showing the actual password or placeholders like `[YOUR-PASSWORD]`?
   - If showing placeholders, the actual password might be different

4. **Verify or Reset**:
   - If you can see the actual password, report it
   - If password needs to be reset, note that option exists

5. **Report back**:
   - What is the actual database password?
   - Is `2022Freshstart` correct?
   - Can the password be reset?

### Alternative: Check Project Settings

Also check:
- Settings → General → Database credentials
- Any section showing database password or connection details

**Once we have the correct password, setup will complete automatically!**
