# Password Authentication Issue

## Problem
Connection string format is correct, hostname resolves, but password authentication fails.

## Status
✅ Connection string format: CORRECT (`postgresql://postgres.wpyntnmjncdizglqedyl:...@aws-1-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres`)
✅ Hostname: RESOLVES (reaching Supabase server)
❌ Authentication: FAILING (password issue)

## Solution Needed

The password `2022Freshstart` might be incorrect, or Supabase might have a different password. 

### Option 1: Verify/Reset Password in Supabase
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wpyntnmjncdizglqedyl/settings/database
2. Look for "Database Password" or "Reset Password" option
3. Reset password if needed
4. Use the new password in connection string

### Option 2: Get Actual Password from Comet
Ask Comet to check if the password shown in the connection string is actually `2022Freshstart` or if it's masked/placeholder.

### Option 3: Try Direct Connection Format
Sometimes pooler format uses different credentials. Try the direct connection:
```
postgresql://postgres:2022Freshstart@db.wpyntnmjncdizglqedyl.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

## Next Steps
Once we have the correct password, I'll update the connection string and complete setup automatically.
