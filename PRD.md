- Uses FDA allometric scaling formula
- Factors in body surface area and weight
- Ensures safety margins

**2. Keto Compatibility Checker (`keto_checker.py`)**
- Validates macronutrient ratios
- Ensures < 50g net carbs per day
- Checks 60-75% fat, 15-30% protein, 5-10% carbs
- Suggests adjustments if not keto-compatible

**3. Protocol Generator (`protocol_generator.py`)**
- Retrieves relevant foods for cancer type
- Calculates personalized doses based on weight
- Builds dosing schedule (servings per day, timing)
- Checks keto compatibility and adjusts
- Saves protocol to database

**4. Compliance Tracker (`track_compliance.py`)**
- Calculates adherence percentage
- Tracks consecutive day streaks
- Identifies missed foods
- Computes 7-day rolling averages

### 3.5 File Storage

### 3.6 Security Considerations

**Current Implementation:**
- No authentication (single-user app)
- CORS restricted to localhost and Replit domains
- File uploads sanitized and validated
- SQL injection prevented via parameterized queries

**Future Enhancements:**
- User authentication (OAuth, JWT)
- HTTPS enforcement
- Data encryption at rest
- Audit logging
- HIPAA compliance considerations

## 6. Business Rules

### 6.1 Protocol Generation Rules

1. **Weight-based dosing:** All food amounts scale with user weight
2. **Safety limits:** Never exceed `max_daily_amount_grams` for any food
3. **Keto compatibility:** Adjust high-carb foods if total net carbs > 50g
4. **Daily regeneration:** Protocol can be regenerated if weight changes
5. **Cancer-type filtering:** Only include foods relevant to user's cancer type

### 6.2 Compliance Tracking Rules

2. **Streak counting:** Consecutive days with 100% adherence
3. **Streak reset:** Any day < 100% resets streak to 0
4. **7-day average:** Rolling average of last 7 days' adherence

### 6.3 Weight Tracking Rules

1. **Measurement protocol:**
   - Naked
   - Morning (before eating/drinking)
   - Weekly recommended
   - Same scale each time

2. **Trend visualization:** Minimum 2 data points required for chart

3. **Goal tracking:** Optional target weight for visual comparison

### 6.4 Keto Compatibility Rules

1. **Net carbs:** < 50g per day (strict < 20g, moderate < 50g)
2. **Macro ratios:**
   - Fat: 60-75% of calories
   - Protein: 15-30% of calories
   - Carbs: 5-10% of calories

3. **Adjustment strategy:**
   - Reduce highest-carb foods by 25%
   - Suggest adding fat sources (olive oil, coconut oil, avocado)

### 6.5 Safety Rules

1. **Drug interactions:** Display warnings for known food-drug interactions
2. **Contraindications:** Show contraindications for each food
3. **Side effects:** List potential side effects

## 7. Special Considerations

### 7.1 Colon Support Herbal Tea

**Custom Blend:**
- Peppermint: 40%
- Chamomile: 30%
- Ginger: 15%
- Fennel: 15%

**Dosing:**
- 8g tea per cup
- 2 cups per day (16g total)
- Morning (upon waking) and Evening (before bed)

**Benefits:**
- Soothes intestinal lining
- Reduces inflammation
- Anti-spasmodic properties
- Supports digestive health

**Preparation:**
- Steep 8g in hot water (not boiling) for 5-7 minutes
- Can add honey if needed

**Documentation:** See `COLON_TEA_INFO.md` for complete details

### 7.2 Green Tea

**Dosing:**
- 750g per day = 3-4 cups
- Distributed throughout afternoon

**Preparation:**
- Water temperature: 160-180Â°F (NOT boiling)
- Steep time: 2-3 minutes
- Avoid adding milk (reduces EGCG absorption)

**Timing:**
- Between meals (better iron absorption)
- Avoid late evening (caffeine)

**Active compound:** EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate)

### 7.3 Garlic Preparation

**Critical Rule:** Crush and wait 10 minutes before eating

**Reason:** Activates allicin (primary anti-cancer compound)

**Dosing:** 10g/day = ~3 cloves

**Preparation methods:**
- Raw (most potent)
- Lightly cooked (retain some allicin)
- Avoid microwaving (destroys compounds)

### 7.4 Turmeric + Black Pepper

**Synergy:** Black pepper increases curcumin absorption by 2000%

**Dosing:**
- Turmeric: 5g/day
- Black pepper: Pinch (0.1g) with each turmeric dose

**Preparation:**
- Mix turmeric powder with black pepper
- Add to fat source (coconut oil, olive oil) for better absorption
- Can be added to meals or made into "golden paste"

## 11. Open Questions & Decisions Needed

### 11.1 Outstanding Questions

1. **Multi-user expansion:** Should this be productized for other cancer patients?
2. **Healthcare provider access:** Should doctors/oncologists have read access?
3. **Data backup:** What's the backup/disaster recovery strategy?
4. **Privacy compliance:** Do we need HIPAA compliance?
5. **Paid vs. Free:** If productized, what's the business model?

### 11.2 Technical Debt

1. **No automated tests:** Need pytest for backend, Jest for frontend
2. **No authentication:** Required for multi-user
3. **Manual database migrations:** Need migration framework
4. **File upload limits:** No virus scanning, size limits not enforced
5. **PubMed integration incomplete:** Fetcher exists but not fully integrated

### 11.3 Design Decisions

1. **Why SQLite?** Simple, serverless, perfect for single-user. May need PostgreSQL for multi-user.
2. **Why no ORM?** Direct SQL is faster, simpler for small schema. May want SQLAlchemy later.
3. **Why React?** Modern, well-supported, TypeScript compatibility.
4. **Why FastAPI?** Fast, automatic API docs, Pydantic validation, async support.
5. **Why Replit?** Easy deployment, free tier, integrated development environment.
