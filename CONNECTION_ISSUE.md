# Connection Issue - Hostname Not Resolving

## Problem
The connection string hostname `db.wpyntnmjncdizglqedyl.supabase.co` is not resolving via DNS.

## Possible Causes

1. **Project might be paused/inactive**
   - Check Supabase dashboard to ensure project is active
   - Free tier projects can pause after inactivity

2. **Connection string format might need adjustment**
   - Supabase sometimes uses different hostname formats
   - May need pooler format instead of direct

3. **Network/DNS issue**
   - Temporary DNS resolution problem
   - Try again in a few minutes

## Solutions to Try

### Option 1: Verify Project Status
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wpyntnmjncdizglqedyl
2. Check if project shows "Active" status
3. If paused, click "Resume" or "Restore"

### Option 2: Get Connection String Again from Comet
Ask Comet to:
1. Go to Settings → Database → Connection string
2. Look for ALL tabs (URI, Connection pooling, etc.)
3. Try copying from "Direct connection" AND "Connection pooling" tabs
4. Report ALL connection strings found

### Option 3: Try Pooler Format
The connection string might need to be pooler format:
```
postgresql://postgres.wpyntnmjncdizglqedyl:2022Freshstart@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
```

### Option 4: Check Supabase Dashboard
1. Settings → Database
2. Look for "Connection info" or "Database URL" 
3. Check if there's a different hostname shown
4. Supabase might show IP address or different domain

### Option 5: Use Supabase CLI
```bash
npm install -g supabase
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref wpyntnmjncdizglqedyl
supabase status
```

This will show the actual working connection strings.

## Next Steps

1. **Verify project is active** in Supabase dashboard
2. **Get connection string again** - ask Comet to check all tabs/sections
3. **Try pooler format** if direct doesn't work
4. **Check Supabase status page** for any outages

The connection string format you found looks correct, so this is likely a project status or DNS issue.
