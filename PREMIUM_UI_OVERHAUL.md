# Premium UI/UX Overhaul Plan

## Status: In Progress

This is a comprehensive redesign to make the application look like a real, professional website - not a home-built project.

## Design Principles

1. **Premium Aesthetics**: Clean, modern, sophisticated
2. **Consistent Design System**: shadcn/ui components, proper spacing, typography
3. **Subtle Animations**: Smooth micro-interactions, not overdone
4. **Professional Color Palette**: Medical/health theme with proper contrast
5. **Proper Visual Hierarchy**: Clear information architecture
6. **Real Vitruvian Man**: Actual Leonardo da Vinci illustration
